# Gatekeeper

API gateway on Cloudflare Workers with an AWS IAM-style authorization engine. Fronts the Cloudflare cache purge API, DNS Records API, Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible storage), and the broader Cloudflare API (D1, KV, Workers, Queues, Vectorize, Hyperdrive). The IAM layer is service-agnostic — the same policy engine handles all services.

## What it does

1. **IAM policy engine** — fine-grained access control via policy documents. Each API key or S3 credential has an attached policy with actions, resources, and conditions (field/operator/value expressions). Think IAM policies, not flat RBAC.
2. **DNS proxy** — DNS record management scoped to specific FQDNs, record types, and actions. ACME clients, CI/CD pipelines, and internal tooling get least-privilege DNS access without a full-zone CF API token.
3. **S3/R2 proxy** — S3-compatible gateway to Cloudflare R2 with per-credential IAM policies. R2's native tokens only support per-bucket read/write — this adds object-level, key-prefix, cross-bucket, and conditional access control. Standard S3 clients (rclone, boto3, aws-cli) work out of the box.
4. **CF API proxy** — proxies D1, KV, Workers, Queues, Vectorize, and Hyperdrive through the same IAM engine. Account-scoped keys with fine-grained actions (e.g., `d1:query`, `kv:get_value`, `workers:update_script`). Wrangler works out of the box via `CLOUDFLARE_API_BASE_URL`.
5. **Rate limit headers** — the purge endpoint returns `Ratelimit` and `Ratelimit-Policy` (IETF Structured Fields format) so clients know their budget.
6. **Token bucket enforcement** — rejects purge requests client-side before they hit the upstream API. Purge: bulk (50/sec, burst 500) and single-file (3,000/sec, burst 6,000). S3: 100/sec, burst 200. CF proxy: 200/sec, burst 400.
7. **Request collapsing** — identical concurrent purges get deduplicated at both isolate and Durable Object levels.
8. **Analytics** — every purge, DNS, S3, and CF proxy operation is logged to D1. Query events, get summaries, filter by key/credential/zone/account/service/time range. CF proxy events are broken down by individual service (D1, KV, Workers, etc.).
9. **Dashboard** — Astro SPA served from the same Worker via Static Assets. Unified analytics view with dynamic per-source tabs.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd gatekeeper
npm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars   # set ADMIN_KEY
npx wrangler dev                 # local development
```

See [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for production setup.
